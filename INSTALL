DEBUGGING:

A file is written in /tmp/ecamera.log that shows the software's debugging log.

To test the USB, go to apogee, "make test_usb", and execute "./test".  It
should printout some numbers like this.
shack:apogee shack$ ./test
find devices done
found 1
DRIVER: opened device
DRIVER: usb write reg=53 data=a55a
DRIVER: usb read reg=53 data=a55a
DRIVER: usb write reg=53 data=5aa5
DRIVER: usb read reg=53 data=5aa5
DRIVER: usb read reg=90 data=ffc0
DRIVER: usb read reg=91 data=c018
DRIVER: usb read reg=92 data=ffff
DRIVER: usb read reg=93 data=0519
DRIVER: usb read reg=94 data=0734
DRIVER: usb read reg=95 data=f28d
DRIVER: usb read reg=96 data=0aca
DRIVER: usb read reg=97 data=ffff

DRIVER: usb read reg=3 data=0080
DRIVER: usb write reg=2 data=2000
DRIVER: usb read reg=91 data=c118
shack:apogee shack$ 

If the USB is working, you can then run the ecamera software manually and enter
the commands to standard input, and the results are written to standard output.
